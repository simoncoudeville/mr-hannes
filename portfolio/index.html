                        The challenge with the KBC was on several levels. Need for a content strategy, more user centered copywriting, Technical SEO &amp; analytics optimalisation,… The biggest challange was to get all the different websites, styles, campagnes, target groups in one platform that could be personalised for every user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We created the ‘app-store’ concept. By atomising needs and products into one page snippets we could create a system where any content could be arranged in a different way for every user. The one page subjects are perfect for SEO and are easy to expand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My role was to attent the user interviews and come up with insights. Starting from national and international good practices I defined the concept and created general agreement with several layers of management. When the concept was clear for everyone I joined the designteam who made some html prototypes. We tested these prototypes and did some cart sorting for the categorysation as well. I also joined the discussion when the development team started on the project. At one point I even coached the content team towards a fitting tone of voice for this website.

                        The city of Ghent has big plans for their online communication. The new website and information architecture is the first step towards cititzen centered communication. The goal was to answer the most asked questions fast and clear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ghent is quite a progressive city in terms of governence, the website should be build in the same way. No less then 26 departmens rewrote content and helped forming the structure of their part of the website. If we wanted to create something the citizen could help we need to break through the department borders and organise content based on theme. Besides of clear information hierarchie we created an on site search function and optimised the site for question asked to Google.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I did was fuel the process by defining design principles and holding on to them. Applying a simple system as Master-Detail to such a complex system of pages and subject was a good plan but asked for a lot of convincing power and stamina. I helped coaching all communication officers from the city and post moderate the structure they’d made. The civilians and Google liked it.

                        Sweepbright is an start-up that wants to support the sales and administration of real estate agents. Their vision is to start mobile first because an agend is always on the move, his office should be with him.

                        The first challange with a non-exesting tool is scoping the MVP, it is a process that never stops throughout the design proces. The next steps were mostly about understanding the live and work of a real estate broker and agency. After that we worked in desgin sprints where user stories were selected, designed, discussed and validated with users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I loved the process because it really challenged my and the visual designer to work on very clear flows and interfaces for complex actions. There was not to much project managment and stakeholders involved so we could go really deap in fitting solutions for real estate agents. After iOS design we translated the design patterns towards a desktop html version of the app. Validating the product not only through user testing but also through sales was very interesting.

                        The strategy of Europabank is clearly NOT to innovate the competitors out of the market. This doesn’t mean that the digital products they provide should be from a previous century. The challange for online banking was keeping things conservative and not to far from what user were used to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nonetheless we chose to work on a responsive webbanking platform, a system that works on all screensizes. Where this kind of software is mostly made in native app, we took the challange to find navigation and interaction patterns that work on all devices. Transactional bank apps focus on speed and correctness of the info. We reduced any many steps and defined smart forms where needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this project I co-designed the patterns that were in the well defined borders, what was pretty hard. I wireframed the whole app using these patterns, settings, contact and help function included.
